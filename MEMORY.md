# TradeOps — Project Memory

> Project-specific state. Our shared "us" story lives in `~/.pi/agent/MEMORY.md`.
> This file holds what TradeOps is, what's built, what's broke, and what's next.

## Mission

Free, open-source on-chain analytics + paper-trading terminal. Rebuild the
professional experience (Chainalysis / Nansen / TradingView) without the
paywalls. No API keys, no accounts, no bullshit.

## Current State (v0.3)

Done:

- TradingView Lightweight Charts (candles, volume, overlays)
- Indicators: Volume, SMA 20/50, EMA 20/50, Bollinger Bands (20, 2),
  RSI 14, MACD (12, 26, 9), VWAP
- 7 timeframes (`1m` → `1w`)
- Multi-provider market data with failover: Binance → Bybit → Coinbase (candles),
  Binance → CoinGecko (tickers). No API keys.
- Watchlist + fuzzy symbol search
- Paper trading: virtual $100k, market orders, 0.1% taker fee, live P&L,
  positions, order history — persisted in-browser (Zustand)
- **On-chain tab in the right panel:** live whale feed (ERC-20 transfers
  ≥ $100K threshold filter), click-through address inspector (inflow/outflow/net
  - transfer history), wallet labeling (Exchange/Whale/VC/MEV/Exploiter/Contract,
    persisted), Etherscan deep links for tx + address
- **Holder analytics (same tab, "Holders" view):** top-50 holders per tracked
  token (USDC/USDT/DAI/WETH/WBTC/LINK/UNI/AAVE) via BlockScout's keyless API —
  concentration bar (top-10 / #11–50 / rest), share %, known-entity names
  (ENS / verified name / public tag), total supply, holder count, market cap,
  price. Click a holder → same address inspector.
- Dark professional UI (TradingView palette)

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, TS) · Tailwind v4 · Lightweight Charts ·
Zustand · public keyless market data APIs + public Ethereum RPC.

## Known Issues / What's Broke

- `ChartPanel.tsx` has pre-existing lint errors (sync `setState` in effects,
  `applyLayout` called before its declaration, one `any`) — cosmetic, not
  user-facing, but clean them up next time we touch the chart.

## Roadmap

- More indicators: Fibonacci, Ichimoku, order-flow heatmaps
- Accounts & cloud sync (optional login) — sync portfolios, labels, watchlists
- Alerts & price notifications
